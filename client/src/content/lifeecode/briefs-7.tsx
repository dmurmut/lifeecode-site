            This week's five stories share a common thread: wearables are moving
            from fitness companions to clinical instruments. A new study shows
            wearables can track Parkinson's disease progression more precisely
            than clinic visits alone. The FDA is opening drug trials to digital
            health tools. A microneedle sensor detects kidney and liver stress
            before standard tests can. Wearable data is strengthening early
            diabetes-risk detection. And a meta-analysis confirms wearables can
            measurably reduce depression and anxiety. The question is whether
            the data they generate will be used to help patients — or to serve
            other interests.

                A study published in npj Parkinson's Disease found that wearable
                sensors worn continuously at home could track Parkinson's
                disease progression more sensitively than standard clinical
                assessments. The researchers used wrist-worn accelerometers to
                measure gait and movement patterns in participants over time,
                detecting statistically significant changes as early as 10
                months before those changes were visible in clinic-based
                evaluations.

                    Wearables are transitioning from passive fitness trackers to

                    the first conditions where continuous home monitoring

                  clinical rating scales (MDS-UPDRS), the wearable data detected
                  disease progression significantly earlier — in some cases up
                  to 10 months before the same change was measurable in a clinic

                        UCLA researchers reported a skin-mounted microneedle
                        sensor that tracked how quickly drugs cleared from the
                        body and revealed early signs of kidney and liver
                        dysfunction in preclinical testing. In the kidney

                        before blood creatinine reached conventional injury

            Next week, LifeeCode is diving into wearables that move from alerts
            to action. The key question is no longer whether devices can sense
            change — it is whether they can turn those signals into
            interventions that are useful, private, and clinically trustworthy.
