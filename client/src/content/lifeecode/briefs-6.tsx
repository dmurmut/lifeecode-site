            Meta just put a health AI inside WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook —
            and it asked users for their raw lab results. This week: Meta's Muse
            Spark expands across its entire consumer ecosystem with health
            capabilities, an FDA-cleared wearable now monitors maternal and
            fetal health wirelessly, ex-Apple engineers launch a privacy-first
            AI wearable, an Oura Ring study links sleep data to cardiovascular
            age, and Humana, Noom, and Welldoc expand patient-controlled health
            data access. Five signals. All filtered through a privacy-first
            lens.

                Meta expanded its Muse Spark AI assistant across WhatsApp,
                Instagram, Facebook, and Messenger in April 2026, giving it
                health-related capabilities. A WIRED investigation revealed that
                the AI had prompted users to share their raw lab results —
                including blood test data — directly in the chat interface. Meta
                described this as an optional feature to help users understand
                their results, but the data flows into Meta's AI training and
                advertising infrastructure.

                  sharing it with an advertising company's AI system. The
                  consent mechanisms are buried in terms of service, not

                        WIRED reported on April 9, 2026 that two former Apple
                        Vision Pro developers launched a wearable AI device
                        designed to listen only when the user deliberately taps
                        it — directly addressing the always-listening problem
                        that has defined most consumer AI hardware. The device
                        is framed around intentional activation rather than
                        passive ambient sensing, positioning privacy-by-design
                        as a core product feature rather than a legal
